I am taking [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mongodb-aggregation-framework/home) course in Coursea.

## Couse Description

This course will teach you how to perform data analysis using MongoDB's powerful Aggregation Framework.

You'll begin this course by building a foundation of essential aggregation knowledge. By understanding these features of the Aggregation Framework you will learn how to ask complex questions of your data. This will lay the groundwork for the remainder of the course where you'll dive deep and learn about schema design, relational data migrations, and machine learning with 
MongoDB.

By the end of this course you'll understand how to best use MongoDB and its Aggregation Framework in your own data science workflow.
